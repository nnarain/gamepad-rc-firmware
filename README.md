# Gamepad RC Firmware

Arduino based firmware for an ESP32 based [gamepad RC stack](https://github.com/nnarain/fc-stacks/tree/develop/blestack02).

This firmware uses [Bluepad32](https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32) to connect to common gamepads and transmit RC controls over serial using the SBUS protocol.
